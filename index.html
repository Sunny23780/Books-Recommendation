                    One way to improve reading efficiency is skimming, which involves quickly moving your eyes over the text to grasp the main ideas. This method helps you identify the most important points without reading every word, saving time when reviewing long articles, reports, or textbooks.

                    Another effective technique is active reading, which includes highlighting key information, taking notes, and asking questions while reading. Engaging with the material in this way enhances comprehension and helps you remember the content more effectively.

                    A third method is timed reading practice, where you set a timer and challenge yourself to read faster while maintaining understanding. This trains your brain to process information quickly and reduces the habit of subvocalizing each word, ultimately increasing overall reading speed.
